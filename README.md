# MedianXL-Save-Helper

I was tired of manually transferring my single player saves from my office computer to my laptop for Diablo 2's MedianXL mod, so I made this very simple program that does it all for me.

# Features

- Automatically archives all local MXL save files
- Uploads the archive to Google Drive for download so that it can be accessed wherever I am playing from

# Future plans

- Clean up the archive after uploading it to Google Drive. For some reason I can't get it to do this right now, maybe a bug with pydrive?
